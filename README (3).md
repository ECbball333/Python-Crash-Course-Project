# Python Crash Course (3rd Ed.) — Labs & Notes

Hands-on exercises and mini-projects I’m completing while working through **Python Crash Course (3rd Edition)**. The repo is organized by chapter for quick navigation and review.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `Chapter 1 - Introduction/`  
- `Chapter 2 - Variables and Simple Data Types/`  
- `Chapter 3 - Introducing Lists/`  
- `Chapter 4 - Working With Lists/`  
- `Chapter 5 - If Statements/`  
- `Chapter 6 - Dictionaries/`  
- `Chapter 7 - Input and While Loops/`  
- `Chapter 8 - Functions/`  
- `Chapter 9 - Classes/`  
- `Cisco Scripts/` — a separate area where I jot down networking-related Python snippets  
- `script.py` — scratchpad / quick experiments  

> Tip: Many examples are standalone scripts. If a chapter has multiple files, run them individually from that chapter’s folder.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.10+ recommended (any 3.8+ should work)
- Optional: `venv` for an isolated environment

```bash
# create & activate a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Run any example**
```bash
# from a chapter folder:
python some_example.py
```
