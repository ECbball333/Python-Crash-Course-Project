# Python Crash Course – Chapter Projects

This repository tracks my progress through the first 17 chapters of *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes. Each chapter introduces foundational Python concepts, and I’ve included my working code, solutions, and experiments here.

The structure is organized by chapter, with hands-on exercises that reinforce concepts like variables, control flow, data structures, functions, file handling, testing, APIs, and basic data visualization.

## 🧪 Practice

- [Pytest Files](./Pytest%20files): Unit testing examples
- [Practice](./Practice): Extra scripts and exercises for reinforcement

## 🚀 What's Next

- The final project in the book is a game: **Alien Invasion**
- I intentionally saved this for last to focus on app development and data work first

After this:
- I’ll move into **network automation**, exploring APIs, dashboards, and LLMs
- My goal is to bridge Python with real-world infrastructure tooling

## 💻 Live Web App Built from These Skills

I’ve already applied the knowledge gained here in my full Django project:  
➡️ [The Learning Log](https://github.com/E-Conners-Lab/The_Learning_log)

This web app is deployed online and lets users track their learning entries in a database-backed site with user auth, CRUD functionality, and a live UI.
