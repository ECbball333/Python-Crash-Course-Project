# Python Crash Course – Chapter Projects

This repository tracks my progress through the first 17 chapters of *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes. Each chapter introduces foundational Python concepts, and I’ve included my working code, solutions, and experiments here.

The structure is organized by chapter, with hands-on exercises that have helped reinforce concepts like variables, control flow, data structures, functions, file handling, testing, APIs, and basic data visualization.

## 🧪 Testing & Practice
- [Pytest files](./Pytest%20files): Practice with writing tests
- [Practice](./Practice): Extra exercises, scripts, and snippets for reinforcement

## 🔁 Project Continuation

The skills developed here were later used in the **[Learning Log](https://github.com/E-Conners-Lab/The_Learning_log)** Django web app — a full-stack application that serves as a live, deployed learning journal.

## 🚀 Next Steps

The final project in the book is a game-based project (Alien Invasion), which I saved for last to focus on applications like automation and data visualization first.

Up next:
- Building the **Alien Invasion** game project
- Diving deeper into **network automation**, **APIs**, and **dashboards**
- Exploring the use of **LLMs** in managing network infrastructure
